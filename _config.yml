  Hello and welcome to my personal website! I am currently a second year PhD student in statistics at the University of Texas at Dallas. 
  <br><br>
  I have a strong passion for statistics/data science and love to see how their applications influence the world around us. 
  <br><br>
  Here I display some of my previous work involving forecasting with time series, implementing statistical and machine learning algorithms, and visual production via Shiny and Ploty.
